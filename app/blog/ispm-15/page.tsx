              Introduction
            </h2>
            <p className="font-montesserat text-sm md:text-base">
              In the global trade industry, ensuring the safe and efficient
              transportation of goods is a top priority. One crucial regulation
              that plays a significant role in international shipping and export
              packing is ISPM 15 (International Standards for Phytosanitary
              Measures No. 15). This regulation addresses the risk of pests and
              diseases being spread through wooden packaging materials used in
              international trade.

              What is ISPM 15?
            </h2>
            <p className="font-montesserat text-sm md:text-base">
              ISPM 15 is a standard developed by the International Plant
              Protection Convention (IPPC) to prevent the spread of harmful
              pests and diseases via wooden packaging materials such as pallets,
              crates, dunnage, and wooden boxes. The regulation applies to any
              solid wood packaging material thicker than 6mm used in export
              shipments.
            </p>
            <p className="font-montesserat text-sm md:text-base">
              To comply with ISPM 15, wood packaging must undergo the following
              approved treatment:
            </p>
            <ul className="font-montesserat list-decimal pl-5 text-sm md:text-base">
              <li>
                <strong>Heat Treatment (HT):</strong> Wood is heated to a
                minimum core temperature of 56Â°C for at least 30 minutes.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p className="font-montesserat text-sm md:text-base">
              After treatment, the packaging must be stamped with the ISPM 15
              mark, which consists of a unique identifier, the IPPC logo, and
              the country code of the treatment provider.

              Importance of ISPM 15 in Export Packing
            </h2>
            <ul className="list-decimal pl-5 font-montesserat text-sm md:text-base">
              <li>
                <strong>Prevention of Pest Infestation:</strong> ISPM 15 plays a
                vital role in preventing the spread of invasive pests that can
                harm ecosystems and agriculture in importing countries. Many
                countries have strict quarantine regulations to protect their
                native species from foreign pests, and ISPM 15 ensures
                compliance with these regulations.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Smooth Customs Clearance:</strong> Adhering to ISPM 15
                standards reduces the risk of shipment delays due to
                non-compliance. Shipments without the appropriate ISPM 15
                certification may be held, treated, or even rejected at the
                destination port, leading to financial losses and supply chain
                disruptions.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Facilitates Global Trade:</strong> ISPM 15
                standardization allows exporters to send goods worldwide without
                concerns about individual country-specific wood packaging
                regulations. This uniformity enhances the efficiency of
                international trade and logistics.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Cost Efficiency:</strong> While ISPM 15 compliance
                involves costs for heat treatment, it ultimately saves
                businesses money by preventing fines, shipment rejections, and
                product recalls due to pest-related issues.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Environmental Protection:</strong> By controlling the
                spread of pests and diseases, ISPM 15 helps maintain
                biodiversity and reduces the need for excessive pesticide use,
                which can harm the environment.
